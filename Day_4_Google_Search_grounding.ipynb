        "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this optional notebook, you will use [Google Search](https://google.com/) results with the Gemini API in a technique called grounding, where the model is connected to verifiable sources of information. Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n",

        "Grounding with Google Search is only available through the API for **\"pay-as-you-go\"** accounts. However, you can try the feature for **no charge** in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). **You are not required to enable billing to complete this course.**\n",
        "\n",

        "Note that Grounding with Google Search has been released as a limited launch and is not available in all locations. The EEA, UK, and CH regions will be supported at a later date. Running this notebook is **optional** and not required for the 5-day GenAI course.\n",
